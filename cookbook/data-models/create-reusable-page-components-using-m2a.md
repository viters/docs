## Explanation

Many websites are made of common, repeating sections or groups of content.

A common use case when using Directus as a headless CMS’s is creating individual blocks that can be re-used on many
different pages.

This enables your content team create unique page layouts without having to use development resources whenever a new
page layout is needed.

In this recipe, we’ll cover the steps needed to create re-usable page components inside your Directus project. Here’s
the quick outline:

- Mapping your data model
- Creating individual page blocks
- Creating your page collection
- Building pages with blocks
- Fetching page data from the API
- Working with your front-end

## How-To Guide

:::tip Requirements

You’ll need to have either a Directus Cloud project configured and running or a self-hosted instance of Directus up and
running.

:::

### Map Out Your Data Model

Before you starting creating Collections inside Directus, it’s helpful to map out your data model (schema) outside of
Directus first.

Consider this sample page below.

![Sample Page](/headlesscms/sample-page.png)

There are three main “blocks” that could be broken down into separate components.

1. A hero block at the top of the page that includes a strong headline, an image, and some copy with a call to action.
2. A block of cards that could link out to blog posts or other content.
3. A block of rich text or HTML content.

Let’s break down the data model for each section.

---

**Hero**

<!-- Insert image here -->

- `headline` - short text that grabs attention (string)
- `content` - longer text that explains the product or service (string)
- `buttons` - group of buttons that link out (array of objects)
  - `label` - call to action like Learn More (string)
  - `href` - URL to link to (string)
  - `variant` - type of button like 'default', 'primary’, or 'outline' (string)
- `image` - supporting image (file)

**Card Group**

<!-- Insert image here -->

- `headline` - short text that describes the section (string)
- `content` - supporting text (textarea)
- `card` - array of objects

  - `image` - featured image of a blog post or content (file)
  - `content` - text summary of a blog post or content (string)

  **Rich Text**

 <!-- Insert image here -->

- `headline` - short text that describes the content (string)
- `content` - rich text / HTML content (string)

---

Now let's create a Collection for each inside Directus.

:::tip

To keep things organized, we recommend that you namespace each collection with a prefix like `block`.

:::

### Create the Rich Text Block

1. [Create a new Collection](/configuration/data-model/collections.html#create-a-collection) named `block_richtext` and
   add the following fields.

   ```md
   block_richtext

   - id (uuid)
   - headline (Type: String, Interface: Input)
   - content (Type: Text, Interface: WYSIWYG)
   ```

### Create the Hero Block

2. [Create a new Collection](/configuration/data-model/collections.html#create-a-collection) named `block_hero` and add
   the following fields.

   ```md
   block_hero

   - id (uuid)
   - headline (Type: String, Interface: Input)
   - content (Type: Text, Interface: WYSIWYG)
   - buttons (Type: JSON, Interface: Repeater)
     - label (Type: String, Interface: Input)
     - href (Type: String, Interface: Input)
     - variant (Type: String, Interface: Input)
   - image (Type: uuid / single file, Interface: Image)
   ```

### Create the Card Group Block

3. [Create a new Collection](/configuration/data-model/collections.html#create-a-collection) named `block_cardgroup` and
   add the following fields.

   ```md
   block_cardgroup

   - id (uuid)
   - headline (Type: String, Interface: Input)
   - content (Type: Text, Interface: WYSIWYG)
   - group_type (Type: String, Interface: Radio, Options: ['posts', 'custom'] )
   - posts (Type: M2M, Conditions: group_type === 'posts')
   - cards (Type: M2O, Conditions: group_type === 'custom')
   ```

### Create the Pages Collection

4. Create a new Collection named `pages` and add the following fields.

   ```md
   pages

   - id (uuid)
   - title (Type: String, Interface: Input)
   - slug (Type: String, Interface: Input, URL Safe: true)
   ```

### Configure a Many-To-Any (M2A) Relationship Inside the `pages` Collection.

5. Create a new Builder (M2A) field inside the `pages` data model.

   ![Many To Any Relationship](/headlesscms/reusable-page-components-m2a-screen.png)

   a. For the **Key**, use `blocks`.

   b. For **Related Collections**, choose the following:

   - Hero
   - Gallery / Cards
   - Article

   c. Save the field. Directus will create a new, hidden
   [junction collection](/configuration/data-model/relationships.html#many-to-any-m2a) for you automatically.

:::tip

If you want more control over the name of the junction table and its fields, use the Continue in Advanced Field Creation
Mode option.

:::

### Create Your Page Content

6. [Create a new item](/app/content/items.html#create-an-item) in the `pages` collection

   <video title="Create Your Page Content" autoplay muted loop controls playsinline>
   <source src="/headlesscms/reusable-page-components-adding-content.mp4"> type="video/mp4" />
   </video>

   a. Enter the page **Title** and **Slug**.

   b. Under the Blocks field, click Create New and choose the collection type to create new blocks. Or click Add
   Existing to re-use existing blocks from other pages. Use the drag handle on the left side of each item to re-order
   blocks.

### Fetching Page Data From the APIs

Next, you'll want to access these with the API. If you try to use `/items/pages` then `page_content` returns an array of
IDs. Instead, you'll want to add a [field parameter](/reference/query.md#many-to-any-union-types) to get nested
relational data.

:::tip

Study the [Global Query Parameters > Fields > Many-To-Any](/reference/query.html#many-to-any-union-types) to learn how
to properly fetch nested relational M2A data without over-fetching data that you might not need.

:::

**Sample Request**

```javascript
// Write some code here in your front-end framework that gets the slug from the current URL.
const slug = 'the-ultimate-guide-to-rabbits';

// Call the Directus API using the SDK.
const response = await directus.items('pages').readByQuery({
	filter: {
		slug: { _eq: slug },
	},
	fields: ['*', 'blocks.*', 'blocks.item.*', '*.collection'],
	limit: 1,
});

const page = response.data[0];
```

### Structuring Your Front End

We have [integration guides](https://directus.io/guides/) for many popular front-end frameworks. But there are far too
many to cover in this recipe.

Here’s some general advice on how to structure your front end to display page blocks / Many-To-Any (M2A) Relationship
data.

**Create a single component for each individual page_builder collection.**

- Hero
- Gallery
- Article

**Create a dynamic route that does the following:**

- Imports your page builder components.
- Calls your `pages` collection via the API. Add a filter rule to match the requested page’s `slug`.
- Maps all the possible `page.pages_blocks.collection` names to your page block components.
- Loops through the `page.blocks` array and passes the correct data (props) that each page_builder component needs to
  render properly.

## Final Tips

This recipe has quite a few steps and involves several different collections. Here are some helpful tips to consider.

### Study the API Response

To prevent frustration when building your front-end, it’s important you understand the structure of the JSON data that
Directus returns for Many To Any (M2A) relationships.

- Complete your page builder data model inside Directus.
- Add some content.
- Test your API calls.

### Check Your Permissions

If you notice you aren't receiving the data that you expect,
[check the Permissions settings](/configuration/users-roles-permissions/permissions.html#permissions) for your Public or
chosen role. You'll have to enable Read access for each collection using in the Pages > Blocks Many-To-Any field.

### Use Typescript

We recommend adding types for each of your different collections to your frontend framework.

### Organize Your Data Model with Folders

Consider using [data model folders](/configuration/data-model/collections.html#create-a-folder) to keep things nicely
organized and your collections easy to find.

![Data Model Folders](/headlesscms/reusable-page-components-folders.png)

### Use Translations for Collection Names

When [setting up Collections](/configuration/data-model/collections.html#collection-setup) within your data model, use
the Collection Naming Translations to create names that easier for the Data Studio users to understand.

![Collection Naming Translations](/headlesscms/reusable-page-components-translations.png)

For example:

- `block_richtext` becomes `Rich Text`
- `block_hero` becomes `Hero` or `Hero Block`
- `block_cardgroup` becomes `Card Group`
