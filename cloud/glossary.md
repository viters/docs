# Glossary

## Asset Storage

Directus Core allows asset storage for any type of file. This applies to all Cloud Projects. However, on Directus Cloud,
certain hard technical limits apply to file uploads, such as limits on size per asset and total asset storage per
Project. For more details, see [Cloud Policies](https://directus.io/cloud-policies#).

## Automatic Updates

Software updates on any app can be a time-consuming chore, taking developer energy and focus away from core business
logic. Cloud Projects are updated every two weeks in rolling releases _(i.e. done with no downtime)_. These updates keep
your Project on the latest version and fully up to date with all [Cloud Exclusives](#cloud-exclusives), dependencies and
security patches.

:::tip Version-locking

Version-locking is available on Enterprise Projects.

:::

## Backups

By default, file assets and databases are backed up once per day on all Standard and Enterprise Projects. Additionally,
Enterprise customers can work with our team for more tailored backup solutions. In the event of an emergency, such as
your Node crashing, don't worry! Your data will be safe. If you need access to your backed-up data,
[contact us](https://directus.io/contact).

:::warning

Please note that Community Projects are not backed up.

:::

## Caching

Caching is enabled on Cloud Projects. Public data is cached in the CDN for a short period of time. All Directus Cloud
Projects are running behind a [Global CDN](#global-cdn), but Enterprise Projects offer advanced caching strategies, as
well.

## Cloud Exclusives

Our managed service includes several Cloud-Exclusive [Extensions](#extensions) that are not available to self-hosted
users. It's important to note that these are **not** paywalled Core features, but are progressive enhancements that add
to the base offering. Our team is always adding new exclusives, so check back often to stay up to date with the latest
and greatest features! Cloud Exclusives development is managed by the Core Team, so these will stay up to date with the
[latest version of Directus](#automatic-updates). Examples include:

- Kanban Layout

:::

## Data Portability

Directus Core is totally detached from the database. Data can be cleanly imported and exported on Projects with the API
via the schema endpoints.

:::tip Enterprise Clients

The Directus Team will help you work through this process on all [Enterprise Projects](https://directus.io/contact).

:::

## Datacenter Regions

The location you choose to host your Project in can have a measurable impact. To help optimize your Project and meet any
local data compliance laws such as GDPR, Standard and Enterprise offer multiple Datacenter regions to host from. There
are 19 regions available for Enterprise Projects, 3 for Standard Projects, and 1 for Community Projects:

## Encryption and Security

[Asset Storage](#asset-storage), data storage and in-transit encryption are included on all Cloud Projects. All data at
rest remains encrypted, and HTTPS/TLS protocols are enabled on all in-transit data. Cloud Projects are created with
secure and safe [tenancy architectures](#multi-tenancy).

:::tip Directus Core Security Features

Directus core comes with even more security features out-of-the-box, including IP address whitelabeling, MFA enabling,
SSO options, customization for Password Rule requirements and the flexibility to use any access token paradigm desired.

:::

## Extensions

The term _Extension_ refers to any feature or component that adds to the functionality of Directus Core. Directus has
been architected to be [completely modular and extensible](/extensions/introduction) to ensure you will never hit a hard
feature ceiling within the platform.

All Cloud Projects have access to the [Cloud Exclusive Extensions](#cloud-exclusives), which are developed and
maintained by the Core Team. Enterprise Projects get all Cloud Exclusives, but also have the option to implement their
own custom Extensions as needed.

## Global CDN

A Global CDN is provided for all Cloud Projects, out-of-the-box, with over 300 cache locations. This means assets and
data will be delivered with the lowest possible latency.

## Infrastructure

In the context of these docs, Infrastructure refers to the hardware running your Project, including the
[database](#multi-tenancy), [serverless nodes](#nodes), [asset storage](#asset-storage) and [global CDN](#global-cdn).
Infrastructure differs by Project tier. Please refer to [Projects](/cloud/projects) as well as the Infrastructure
section on the [Pricing page](https://directus.io/pricing) for side-by-side comparisons.

## Nodes

When you configure a project on Directus Cloud, you get to choose processing power of its Nodes as well as the number of
Nodes it runs on. You can configure and reconfigure Nodes to meet traffic needs at any scale.

In general, there are two approaches to scale performance: vertical-scaling and horizontal-scaling. Vertical-scaling
refers to the use of improved hardware _(e.g. better CPUs and more RAM)_ to scale up. In Directus Cloud, configuring the
Node Type will provide vertical-scaling. Horizontal-scaling refers to increasing the number of Nodes to scale up. In
Directus Cloud, adding more Reserved Nodes will provide horizontal-scaling.

### Node Types

Each offering provides a different level of node processing power.

- **Community**\
  Community Projects come equipped with one Node, which can handle basic web traffic required for hobby projects, learning
  and demoing Directus Cloud, and other non-production use cases. Community Nodes are paused after a certain duration of
  runtime. However, you can [extend this period](/cloud/projects#resume-a-community-project) forever.

- **Standard**\
  Standard Projects provide better performance, such as for handling image transformations as well as fetching deeply nested
  or complex relationships via the API.

- **Enterprise**\
  Configuration options are flexible and customizable, tailored to your Project's needs.

### Reserved Nodes

The term **Reserved Nodes** indicates the number of nodes available to immediately handle incoming requests, including
rapid spikes.This determines your base [monthly billing](/cloud/teams.md#manage-billing).

## Quotas

Directus does not impose _arbitrary_ software-based limits of any kind. So for things like Collections, Roles or Users -
whether you have 10 or 10,000 of them - you are free to build out your Project as needed, with no up-charge. However,
actual Project performance is going to depend on Node configuration, so there are hard technical limits. For details,
see [Cloud Policies](https://directus.io/cloud-policies).

## Rate Limiting

Rate limiting refers to technical limitations within Directus Cloud as well as Cloud Projects. You will encounter the
following API request limits at each node tier.

| Tier       | Limit                                               |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Community  | 10 requests per second per IP _(50 per second max)_ |
| Standard   | 50 requests per second per node per IP              |
| Enterprise | 100 requests per second per node per IP             |

:::tip

These limits are additive and load balanced. For example, a Standard Project with two Standard Tier nodes would get 100
requests per second per IP `50 requests * 2 nodes = 100`.

## Support Options

There are three types of support for Directus:

### Community Support

Because Directus is an open-source Project, you're encouraged to reach out to the Community for help on Projects, _and
of course help others as well_. Find us on [GitHub](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions) and
[Discord](https://directus.chat) to join the thousands of other developers all discussing and guiding the future of the
Directus platform. Most common questions have already been asked and answered and can be easily searched.

:::warning No Guaranteed Response Time

While the Directus Core Team plays an active and engaged role in community discussions and aims to answer questions
within a few days, there is no guaranteed response time for Community Support.

:::

### Basic and Premium Support

Basic and Premium Support offer direct communication with the Directus Core Team. Basic support is included on all
Enterprise Projects, and Premium Support adds 24/7 response times for critical software issues only.

:::tip Add-on Support

Looking for Basic or Premium Support on a self-hosted Project? [Contact Sales](https://directus.io/contact).

Click <span mi icon>check</span> in the Dashboard Header to navigate to the System Status page. This page is where to
_find out what happened_ in the super rare event that the network slows down or goes offline. Here you can view the
current connectivity status of Directus Cloud, the status on individual Projects by URL and a daily Incidents log. For
more information, see [Cloud Policies](https://directus.io/cloud-policies#).

## Multi-tenancy

Tenancy refers to how client data is stored within a database. In single-tenancy architecture, a database stores data
from only one tenant. In multi-tenancy architecture, a database stores data from multiple tenants, with mechanisms in
place to protect data privacy. In the context of Directus Cloud, each Project represents a tenant.

**Community**\
Community project databases are technically single-tenant, but also file-based, and therefore may be too limited on power
for a production-ready environment.

**Standard**\
Standard Projects are created using a multi-tenant architecture. However, if your neighbor's Project gets busy, it will not
impact your Project, because each Standard Project is scoped to one container per Project with dedicated minimum resources.
Projects also have the ability to scale beyond this minimum allocation based on currently available resources within the
multitenant pool. However, these additional resources are not guaranteed and are offered on a dynamic first-come, first-serve
basis. For end-to-end, single-tenant infrastructure with fully dedicated resources, [contact us about our Enterprise Tier](https://directus.io/contact)

**Enterprise**\
Databases on Enterprise Projects are single-tenant, 100% dedicated to your Project - no neighbors! Ready to upgrade to Enterprise?

:::tip

This section refers to how your Cloud Project is stored alongside other Cloud Projects and has nothing to do with how
you design your Project's data model. You can implement single or multi-tenant architecture within any Directus Cloud
Project.
